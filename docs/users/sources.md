# Getting sources

The best thing about horsy - open-source. We encourage developers adding sources of their apps, so you can get them!

## CLI
```
horsy source <app>
```

## TUI
```
horsy
3
<app>
```

## GUI
Search for app in `Browse` tab

Select needed app

Click `Get source` button

## What happens
If developer provided app sources, you will see browser with sources link

If not, horsy will notify you
