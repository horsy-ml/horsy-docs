# First GUI launch

So, you installd GUI. You can see desktop shortcut for ```horsy GUI```, also you can use terminal to launch it, type
```
horsygui
```

Whis will run ```horsygui.exe``` with console, and if you have default terminal, it will hide terminal window. If you have custom terminal, something like ```Windows Terminal``` (default on Windows 11), horsy won't hide it.

If you launch it first time, you will empty installed window, something like this:

![Empty installed window](/img/for-users/first-gui-launch/empty-installed.png)

If you see strange laggs - don't worry. If noone uses server, it stops itself, so now it loads, it will take several seconds.

So let's install some apps!

We installed ```drawhorse``` in CLI guide, so let's install ```kotogamescam``` - free open-source memory scanner/debugger

Click ```Browse``` tab.

In search box, type app name. We use `Algolia` for searching, so you can type two-three letters, search by description and even dependencies.

![Search](/img/for-users/first-gui-launch/kotosearch.png)

Press `Search` button.

![Found](/img/for-users/first-gui-launch/found.png)

Now, select `kotogamescam` app and press `Install` button

You will see logs box and it will say you all about downloading and installing process.

Now you see
```
All done!
 You can run your app by entering kotogamescam in terminal
```
It means that everything is OK and you now cat run kotogamescam just entering `kotogamescam` in terminal!
