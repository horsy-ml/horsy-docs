# Getting information

You found interesting app, but you don't know anything about it?

It's great idea to get information about it.

## CLI
```
horsy info <app>
```

## TUI
```
horsy
6
<app>
```

## GUI
Search for app in `Browse` tab

Select needed app

Click `Info` button or double click on app

## What happens
You will see popup window (if you are using gui) or text (if CLI/TUI) with app information

It seems to be something like this:
```
<app name><✅ if app verified else nothing> by <developer>
<Descriprion>
👍<likes> | 👎<dislikes>
```

More about verified apps you can see **[here](/docs/more/verification)**
