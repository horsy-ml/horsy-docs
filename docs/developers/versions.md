# Version system
We use version system to keep track of app updates.

To force update, you can use button in GUI.

Navigate to `Account` tab, select package in `Manage your packages` table and click `Request selected package update on user side` button.

When user will click on `Check all updates` button, or will use `horsy updates` command, horsy will notify about new versions of apps.
