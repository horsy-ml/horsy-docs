# Changing credentials
For some reason, you need to change your credentials.

We provide you this option on `Account` tab in horsygui

To increase account security, we don't provide changing your nickname option and to change your credentials, you need to have valid login in config file

## Changing email
In email field, type your new email address and press `Change e-mail` button.

You will receive an email with confirmation link.

If you don't have access to your email or you have forgotten your password, you can't change your email. Also, if you don't have an account in config, you can't change your email.

## Changing password
To change your password, type old and new password and press `Change password` button.

If old pass doesn't match with passowrd in config file, you will get an error.

So, if you changed password on other device, you need to log out and log in again.
