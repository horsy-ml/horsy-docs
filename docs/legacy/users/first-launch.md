# First launch

We are sure that you are eager to run horsy and initialize your first app installation. So let's start!

First, open your Terminal. If you can't stand CLI apps, skip this tutorial and read next ```First GUI launch```.

horsy is very user-friendly app, so you have choise at every step of using The Best Package Manager!

Now type this in your terminal:
```
horsy
```
Yes. Just ```horsy```. You will see beautifull ASCII horsy logo and TextUI (TUI), where you can choose number option.

Another way to use horsy is CLI. It works like
```
horsy [command] <app>
```
For example:
```
horsy install drawhorse
```
or
```
horsy i drawhorse
```

If you prefer using TUI, type ```0``` (option for install app) and type, for example ```drawhorse```

horsy will install the newest version of app

VirusTotal configuring is availible **[here](/docs/more/virustotal)**.

If everything is OK, you will see
```
[OK] All done!
You can run your app by entering drawhorse in terminal
```
